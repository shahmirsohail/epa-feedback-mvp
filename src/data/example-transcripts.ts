      'Attending: "Walk me through your triage assessment of the patient with sudden shortness of breath and chest pain."\nResident: "I started with airway, breathing, and circulation, put the patient on continuous monitoring, and asked nursing for repeat vitals every five minutes because he looked diaphoretic."\nAttending: "Good initial prioritization. What was your immediate differential?"\nResident: "I considered acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, and aortic pathology. I ordered ECG, troponins, chest x-ray, and bedside ultrasound while we got IV access."\nAttending: "You moved quickly, and your ECG interpretation was accurate. Where did you feel uncertain?"\nResident: "I hesitated on whether to start anticoagulation before imaging because he had mild hemoptysis. I called senior early and we decided to stabilize first and reassess after CTPA."\nAttending: "That was appropriate uncertainty management. You asked for help early instead of guessing. One improvement area: say your treatment priorities out loud sooner so the team hears the plan, not just the orders."\nResident: "So I should verbalize, \"oxygen now, pain control, serial ECGs, and escalation triggers\" while tests are pending?"\nAttending: "Exactly. Next shift, practice a 20-second verbal plan at bedside for every high-risk chest pain case. I’ll listen to two of them and give you feedback."\nResident: "Got it. I’ll also include a clear contingency statement if blood pressure drops or pain worsens."\nAttending: "Great. Keep the fast assessment you already do, and pair it with explicit team communication to improve safety."'

    transcript:
      'Attending: "Your rounds presentation on bed 14 was much clearer today. Can you summarize your reasoning?"\nResident: "Overnight urine output fell, creatinine rose, and she gained two kilograms, so I treated this as cardiorenal congestion rather than isolated AKI."\nAttending: "I liked that you linked the data to physiology. What concrete actions did you take?"\nResident: "I adjusted diuretics, set electrolyte checks for this afternoon, reduced nephrotoxic meds, and updated nursing on strict input-output targets."\nAttending: "Nice job coordinating the plan. Where were you uncertain?"\nResident: "I wasn’t sure whether to hold the ACE inhibitor completely or just reduce it. I reviewed yesterday’s blood pressures and discussed with pharmacy before deciding on a temporary hold."\nAttending: "Good use of interprofessional support. Improvement point: your differential for rising creatinine came late in the presentation, after a long problem list."\nResident: "So lead with the top one or two active priorities, then secondary issues?"\nAttending: "Yes. Start with the sickest problem, then your plan, then what you are watching for. That structure helps the whole team."\nResident: "For tomorrow, I’ll open with a one-sentence problem representation and explicit monitoring thresholds."\nAttending: "Excellent next step. Bring that format to rounds and I’ll coach you in real time."'

      'Attending: "I observed your family meeting this afternoon. How do you think it went?"\nResident: "I explained why we escalated antibiotics, reviewed the CT findings in plain language, and checked what the daughter understood before discussing next steps."\nAttending: "You did a strong job avoiding jargon, and your empathy was noticeable. What specific communication move helped?"\nResident: "I paused after each major update and asked, \"What questions do you have right now?\" That seemed to reduce their anxiety."\nAttending: "Agreed. Where did uncertainty come up?"\nResident: "They asked if her confusion would fully recover by discharge, and I said we can’t promise timeline yet because infection is improving but delirium often lags. I offered daily reassessment instead of a fixed prediction."\nAttending: "That was honest and appropriate. One improvement area: you moved to logistics before exploring values."\nResident: "I should ask what outcomes matter most to them before finalizing the care plan?"\nAttending: "Exactly. Next time, use this coaching prompt: \"Before we decide today’s plan, can you tell me what your mom would prioritize if recovery is slower than expected?\""\nResident: "I like that. I’ll use it tomorrow and document their priorities in the note so the team can align."\nAttending: "Perfect. Keep your clear explanations, and strengthen shared decision-making with that values-first step."'

      'Attending: "Let’s review your signover to the night team. What did you intentionally include?"\nResident: "I used SBAR, gave one-liners for each patient, flagged pending blood cultures and repeat lactate, and added escalation triggers for hypotension."\nAttending: "The contingency planning was strong. I also noticed you gave clear timelines for reassessment."\nResident: "I was trying to reduce ambiguity because two patients were borderline unstable."\nAttending: "Good instinct. Where did you feel less certain?"\nResident: "For bed 9, I wasn’t sure if overnight fever would be from line infection or progression of pneumonia, so I told the junior both were possible and what data would push us either way."\nAttending: "That explicit uncertainty statement was excellent. Improvement area: you forgot to include code status on one patient and had to backtrack."\nResident: "Right, I relied on memory instead of a checklist."\nAttending: "Next-step coaching: use a fixed closing line for every patient—\"code status, pending tests, if-then trigger, and who to call.\" Practice it until automatic."\nResident: "I’ll put that in my signover template and ask the senior to audit two handovers this week."\nAttending: "Great plan. Your handover is already concise; this will make it safer and more complete."'

What actions did you take after the consult?"\nResident: "I updated our orders to include proton pump inhibitor infusion, adjusted transfusion targets based on their recommendation, and documented rationale in the chart."\nAttending: "Nice integration. Any uncertainty you had to manage?"\nResident: "I wasn’t sure whether to continue DVT prophylaxis overnight given bleeding risk. I clarified with GI and then discussed balancing thrombosis risk with the senior."\nAttending: "Good example of not making assumptions. Improvement area: your note listed recommendations but didn’t clearly state which ones we deferred and why."\nResident: "So I should explicitly write accepted versus deferred recommendations with clinical reasoning?"\nAttending: "Exactly. Next-step coaching: use a three-line consult summary—question asked, recommendation received, and decision with justification."\nResident: "I’ll use that format for the next two consults and show you my documentation."\nAttending: "Excellent. Keep your clear calls and strengthen the written reasoning trail for continuity."'

Walk me through what you did."\nResident: "I reconciled medications, stopped duplicative antihypertensives, arranged follow-up in one week, and used teach-back to confirm he understood warning signs."\nAttending: "Your teach-back was excellent, especially when you asked him to repeat when to return to ED."\nResident: "He initially mixed up the new diuretic dose, so we corrected it together and printed a simplified schedule."\nAttending: "Great catch. Where were you uncertain?"\nResident: "I wasn’t sure if he could afford the inhaler change, so I involved social work and pharmacy before finalizing prescriptions."\nAttending: "Good uncertainty handling with team resources. Improvement area: pharmacy was looped in late, which compressed teaching time."\nResident: "I should involve them earlier when there are multiple medication changes?"\nAttending: "Exactly. Next-step coaching: by noon, flag high-risk discharges and send pharmacy a brief summary so they can prepare counseling."\nResident: "I’ll build that into my workflow tomorrow and track whether discharge delays improve."\nAttending: "Perfect.

      'Attending: "During the rapid response, what was your first move when the patient became hypotensive and confused?"\nResident: "I called for additional help, reassessed airway and perfusion, started a fluid bolus, and assigned one nurse to repeat blood pressure every three minutes."\nAttending: "You stayed calm and organized the room quickly. What differential were you considering?"\nResident: "Septic shock, hemorrhage, arrhythmia, and less likely obstructive causes. I ordered lactate, cultures, ECG, and bedside ultrasound while we prepared vasopressors."\nAttending: "Strong broad framing. Where did uncertainty arise?"\nResident: "I wasn’t sure whether fluid responsiveness would be limited by heart failure history, so I gave smaller boluses with frequent reassessment and discussed early ICU transfer."\nAttending: "That was thoughtful risk balancing. Improvement area: your differential was mostly in your head; the team heard tasks but not your reasoning."\nResident: "I should narrate the top concerns in real time so everyone aligns?"\nAttending: "Yes. Next-step coaching: in unstable events, state a one-sentence situation update every five minutes—working diagnosis, response to treatment, and next trigger."\nResident: "I’ll practice that on the next call and ask charge nurse for feedback on clarity."\nAttending: "Excellent. Your technical response is strong; explicit team updates will make it even safer."'

Where were you uncertain?"\nResident: "They asked if choosing DNR meant no treatment at all. I clarified that we would still treat reversible issues, but I paused because I wanted to be precise and not misleading."\nAttending: "You handled that uncertainty well by clarifying scope of care. Improvement area: after difficult moments, you moved quickly to documentation rather than checking emotional processing."\nResident: "So I should ask something like, \"Can you tell me how this plan feels to you right now?\" before closing?"\nAttending: "Exactly. Next-step coaching: end every serious-illness discussion with values summary, medical plan, and an invitation to revisit decisions if condition changes."\nResident: "I’ll use that structure and schedule a follow-up conversation tomorrow morning."\nAttending: "Great.

What did you do concretely after recognizing that?"\nResident: "I reviewed current guidelines, made a one-page diagnostic algorithm, and tested it on two admissions from this week."\nAttending: "That initiative is excellent. What uncertainty remains for you?"\nResident: "I still feel unsure when urine sodium is hard to interpret after recent diuretics, so I noted that as a specific question for nephrology teaching."\nAttending: "Great example of narrowing uncertainty into a teachable point. Improvement area: your reflection stayed individual; you didn’t yet share learning with the team."\nResident: "I can bring a brief teaching pearl to rounds and ask for feedback on my algorithm use?"\nAttending: "Exactly. Next-step coaching: present a two-minute \"what changed in my practice\" update tomorrow and apply the algorithm on your next new consult."\nResident: "I’ll do that and track whether I reach a working differential faster."\nAttending: "Perfect.

Start with your preparation."\nResident: "I confirmed indication, reviewed coagulation profile, obtained informed consent, and performed a timeout with nursing before setting up sterile equipment."\nAttending: "Preparation was thorough, and your ultrasound localization was efficient. What procedural actions went well?"\nResident: "I maintained sterile technique, used real-time ultrasound to avoid bowel, and removed fluid smoothly without immediate complications."\nAttending: "Agreed. Where were you uncertain?"\nResident: "When the initial return was slow, I wasn’t sure if I was against omentum or just in a shallow pocket. I paused, rescanned, and adjusted angle before continuing."\nAttending: "Good judgment not to force it. Improvement area: your timeout script was quiet, so team members couldn’t all hear site confirmation and safety checks."\nResident: "I should lead the timeout in a louder standardized format and require verbal confirmation from each person?"\nAttending: "Exactly. Next-step coaching: use a scripted checklist and closed-loop confirmation for consent, laterality, supplies, and post-procedure monitoring plan."\nResident: "I’ll practice that on my next procedure and ask the nurse to score my clarity."\nAttending: "Excellent.

What concrete follow-up did you put in place?"\nResident: "I ordered additional vitals and labs, informed pharmacy and nursing leadership, and submitted the safety report before end of shift."\nAttending: "Good systems response. Where did uncertainty come up for you?"\nResident: "I wasn’t certain how much causality to claim because symptoms were mild and could be multifactorial, so I used language about possibility and committed to updates as data came back."\nAttending: "That was appropriate and honest. Improvement area: questions from the family came late because you spoke for several minutes before inviting them in."\nResident: "I should pause earlier and ask what concerns they want addressed first?"\nAttending: "Yes. Next-step coaching: open disclosures with three steps—what happened, immediate safety actions, then an invitation for questions before details."\nResident: "I’ll rehearse that structure with senior tomorrow so I can use it more naturally."\nAttending: "Great.

    expectedEpa: "Likely FOD-1 (secondary FOD-2C/FOD-5/FOD-2B, confidence depends on rationale)",
    transcript:
      `Attending: "Let’s do a full debrief of the shift, from triage to handover. I want your self-assessment first: where were you strong, where were you uncertain, and where did safety feel fragile?"
Resident: "I think I prioritized acuity reasonably, but I felt task-saturated during the 16:00 to 18:00 surge. We had chest pain in Bed 12, septic shock concern in Bed 3, postpartum headache in Bed 15, and an elderly delirium case in Bed 7. I did well on early ECG and initial escalation, but I noticed cognitive drift toward disposition pressure when the waiting room climbed."
Attending: "Good start. Walk me through Bed 12 in detail. Don’t skip your differential evolution."
Resident: "Fifty-eight-year-old with central chest pressure radiating to jaw, nausea, diaphoresis, borderline hypotension after sublingual nitro from EMS. I treated as high-risk ACS until proven otherwise: monitor, repeat ECGs, serial high-sensitivity troponins, focused exam for heart failure signs, and early nurse communication for q15 vitals. Differential also included aortic syndrome and PE because pain onset was abrupt while lifting and he described a tearing quality for about a minute before pressure pattern dominated. I considered dissection less likely after exam and CXR, but I documented why it stayed in differential pending reassessment."
Attending: "You escalated quickly, which was excellent. Where did I have to prompt you?"
Resident: "I initially framed disposition too early—said if second troponin is negative we might discharge with close follow-up. You challenged me to reframe around dynamic risk, persistent symptoms, and overnight access barriers. I realized I was unconsciously optimizing flow over risk."
Attending: "Exactly. Throughput pressure is real, but disposition language can anchor teams. Next case: Bed 3, presumed sepsis. What happened?"
Resident: "Seventy-three-year-old with fever, confusion, hypotension, tachypnea. I activated sepsis pathway, broad-spectrum antibiotics after blood cultures, fluid bolus adjusted for probable heart failure history, lactate, and early vasopressor discussion when MAP remained low. I asked respiratory therapy for VBG trend and oxygen titration. I think I communicated urgency well, but I was slower than ideal to assign closed-loop task ownership, so duplicate orders happened once and one repeat pressure was delayed."
Attending: "Your physiology reasoning was solid. Team leadership under noise needs sharpening. I heard you ask for ‘someone to repeat vitals,’ but no named owner. What would better sound like?"
Resident: "‘Nurse Patel, please repeat BP in five minutes and tell me directly if MAP stays under 65.’ Then I should repeat back the contingency in one sentence."
Attending: "Good. Bed 15 postpartum headache—this one matters because misses can be catastrophic."
Resident: "Eight days postpartum, severe headache, photophobia, elevated blood pressure, nausea. I considered migraine and post-dural puncture headache too early and should have foregrounded postpartum preeclampsia, CVST, and intracranial hemorrhage sooner. After your prompt, I repeated neuro exam, ordered urgent labs including liver profile and urine protein ratio, called OB early, and discussed neuroimaging pathway with radiology. I delayed magnesium discussion by around twenty minutes; that’s the part I’m least comfortable about."
Attending: "I agree with your self-assessment. You recovered well, but initial framing was too benign for the context. What language did you use with the patient once you pivoted?"
Resident: "I said: ‘Most headaches are not dangerous, but in the postpartum period your symptoms can signal serious complications. We’re treating this urgently while we run tests to identify the cause quickly.’ She seemed anxious but understood why we broadened care."
Attending: "That communication was clear and compassionate. Keep that wording template. Now Bed 7, delirium after a fall."
Resident: "I initially over-focused on trauma imaging because of anticoagulation history. CT was negative and I almost stopped the diagnostic search. After your cue, I reframed delirium as syndrome: infection, urinary retention, medication effects, pain, dehydration, constipation, hypoxia, and environmental disorientation. Collateral from daughter revealed recent anticholinergic sleep aid and baseline hearing impairment. We addressed retention, medication review, orientation aids, and avoided restraints. I regret that my first wording implied restraints too early before trying least-restrictive measures."
Attending: "Important insight. Policy and culture follow language. Also your documentation captured tests but not your collateral reasoning. Why does that matter?"
Resident: "Because the chart then under-represents risk reasoning and can mislead overnight teams about why we chose non-pharmacologic delirium strategies first. It also weakens handover quality if the note reads like a checklist instead of a clinical narrative."
Attending: "Exactly. Let’s talk handover itself. Your verbal sign-out had strengths and gaps."
Resident: "Strengths: I used one-liner plus active problems, flagged pending troponin and repeat lactate, and gave clear triggers for escalation in Bed 3 if vasopressor threshold crossed. Gaps: I rushed code-status summary on two patients and forgot to explicitly state uncertainty for postpartum headache differential, which made the plan sound narrower than intended."
Attending: "That’s the key: communicate uncertainty explicitly, not implicitly. Under fatigue, teams hear certainty unless you name alternatives. What about procedures today?"
Resident: "I did one ultrasound-guided peripheral IV and one simple laceration repair. IV first pass failed because my probe-hand drifted and I lost tip visualization. Second pass succeeded after lowering entry angle and narrating landmarks out loud. Laceration repair was technically fine, but my consent explanation was rushed because family pressure was rising and I didn’t pause for questions."
Attending: "Technical competence is progressing. Communication during procedures is your next step. Now professionalism: any interaction you want to revisit?"
Resident: "I was abrupt with respiratory therapy when an ABG was delayed. I apologized, but I still own that tone. I need a stress-reset phrase before speaking when multiple alarms are firing."
Attending: "Good repair and good awareness. Let’s convert this into concrete goals for next week."
Resident: "Goal one: for high-risk presentations—chest pain, severe headache, altered mental status—I will do a 20-second ‘can’t-miss’ diagnostic timeout before discussing discharge. Goal two: use named closed-loop assignments for reassessments when vitals are unstable. Goal three: during handover I will include code status, uncertainty statement, and escalation triggers for every active patient."
Attending: "Add a fourth: special-population trigger. For postpartum, frail geriatric delirium, and immunocompromised fever, broaden early and consult earlier than feels comfortable. Don’t wait for complete certainty."
Resident: "Agreed. I’ll also ask the senior to audit two of my handovers and two bedside risk conversations using teach-back so I get objective feedback."
Attending: "Excellent. Final entrustment summary: you are approaching autonomy in routine acute care if cognitive load is moderate. Under high task density, you still need intermittent support to maintain prioritization, explicit uncertainty communication, and closed-loop leadership. Your trajectory is strong because you’re reflective, coachable, and you make real-time corrections."
Resident: "Thank you. That’s specific and actionable—I’ll carry these goals on my shift card and review after each block."`
